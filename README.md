# Europe Regional Datathon Fall 2021

In November of 2021 I took part in Citadel's European Datathon where I worked in a team of four to use data analysis techniques and machine learning to explore how various linguitic decisions impact the rate at which readers are choosing to read online articles.

This project utilised multiple python packages such as sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and well as use of Microsoft Excel.

The given data consisted of different article titles which were assigned to the same articles, and the amount of clicks that each recieved. This also consisted of time series data of the overall engagement over time.

To complete the task I carried out data cleaning and natural language processing in order to identify and analyse the impact of the use of punctuation in the article titles. I carried out logistic regression and evaluated the significance of the results. My initial code for the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/europe_regional_datathon_fall_2021/blob/main/Question_and_exclamation_marks-Copy1.ipynb) and the final report can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/europe_regional_datathon_fall_2021/blob/main/Team_13_Report.pdf).
